# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Advanced Calculator

This is a web-based advanced calculator application built using React.js. It supports various mathematical functions, trigonometric calculations, memory operations, and more.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Functions:** Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms (natural logarithm and base-10 logarithm), exponentials, power functions, factorial, square root, and more.
- **Memory Operations:** Memory recall, addition, and subtraction (MC, M+, M-).
- **Constants:** Pi (Ï€) and Euler's number (e).
- **Error Handling:** Displays "Error" on invalid inputs or operations.
- **Theme Switching:** Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Confetti Animation:** Celebrates certain calculations with a confetti explosion effect.

## Usage

1. **Installation**

Install dependencies:


2. **Run**

   **num run dev**

Start the React development server:


The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

3. **Usage**

- Enter mathematical expressions or click on the buttons to perform calculations.
- Use memory operations to store or recall values.
- Toggle themes with the "T" button to switch between light and dark modes.
- Certain calculations trigger a confetti animation for celebration.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS:** Styling and theming.
